** MAKE SURE YOUR REPOSITORY IS PRIVATE**

File structure *example* for final projects. Each project should have a readMe file that explains their file structure and key files. Yours should have a bit more detail than this example and should be tailored to your project (so feel free to adjust as useful, but make sure it is very organized).

1. Preprocessing folder

- This folder contains organized and annotated R code for exploring the data, wrangling the data, joining data, and any other steps needed to get us to our final clean data csv file. There are 2 files:

    1. cross-sectional analysis: In this section we performed an initial cross sectional analysis to better understand the our dataset. This is a collection of our initial notes that inspired the later analyses for the project. We looked into various aspect X, Y, and Z.
    2. case-study analysis: This folder contains code for our case study analysis where we zero in on one X to deeply exmaine patterns of A, B, and C.

2. Data folder

- This folder contains all the data used or explored in the project.
- This folder also contains a subfolder called "clean data" where our FINAL data is stored and used to generate our report.

3. Main findings

- In this folder you can run the final "main_findings.rmd" to easily replicate all of the main findings of our work. (Instructor note: anything that makes it into your final report or your presentation should be replicated here using the 'final data' csv you made).
- This code should have brief annotations but not the full writing of the final report.

4. Deliverables

- Final report: this can be using markdown (recommended to push yourself, use markdown) or via a word document.
- FOR ALL FINAL DOCUMENTS, you must have high quality graphics and tables! No rough screenshots!
- Final slides.

# Other notes:

In the past, some people also wrote some notes for their team in the readME, such as key deadlines. That is fine! Include whatever else is helpful, but keep it clean, well organized, and not too long in length.

Suggested timeline (you should adjust for your team):

Week 1-2 : Choose data set and research topic (by 10/27)
Week 3-4 : Wrangle data and perform analyses (by 11/10)
Week 5-7 : Write draft research paper (by 11/30)
Week 8 : Create presentation and practice presenting (by 11/7)
Week finals : Edit and submit final research paper (due 12/11 at 11:59 PM, presentation on 12/12 at 9am-noon.)
