** MAKE SURE YOUR REPOSITORY IS PRIVATE**

File structure example for final projects. Each project should have a readMe file that explains their file structure and key files. Yours should have a bit more detail than this example and should be tailored to your project (so feel free to adjust as useful, but make sure it is very organized).

1. Preprocessing folder

- This folder contains organized and annotated R code for exploring the data, wrangling the data, joining data, and any other steps needed to get us to our final clean data csv file. There are 5 files:

    1. cross-sectional analysis: In this section we performed an initial cross sectional analysis to better understand the our dataset. This is a collection of our initial notes that inspired the later analyses for the project. We looked into various aspect X, Y, and Z.
    2. case-study analysis: This folder contains code for our case study analysis where we zero in on one X to deeply exmaine patterns of A, B, and C.

2. Data folder

- This folder contains all the data used or explored in the project.
- This folder also contains a subfolder called "clean data" where our FINAL data is stored and used to generate our report.

3. Main findings

- In this folder you can run the final "main_findings.rmd" to easily replicate all of the main findings of our work. (Instructor note: anything that makes it into your final report or your presentation should be replicated here using the 'final data' csv you made but there could be other things you do not include in the report that you do include here).
- This code should have brief annotations but not the full writing of the final report.

4. Deliverables

- Final report that is an .rmd file.
- Final slides.
